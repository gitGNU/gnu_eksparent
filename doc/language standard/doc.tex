	\section*{Foreword}

	This project was made as a try to simplify the parsing and make it look cleaner.
	i found that xml: were to ''boldy'' <a>some text</a> is taking alot of space. The configuration file markup language is too simple and not very standardized. 
	The tex markup language is one of my favorites, but it may be a pain to write \\\_ instead of \_. 
	The yaml markup language is simple and close to my goal, but it still have alot of things that just complicates stuff. Also i wanted a markup language with the simple multi-comment syntax /* something */.
	Well i just mentioned some things i found as flaws, also my language wont be perfect nor will it fulfill my goals. Someone will probably come up with an even better language, but i think this is in the right way.

	\section*{Abstract}
	
	This is the programming standard for the markup language - eks. 
	Eks is mainly designed not to be bound to the english language (when used). Its also designed mainly to be easy to read.
	
	\emph{Note: This is an early version of the markup language. Functionality of eks may change until version 1.0, an example may be that the ascii char for a vector may be \& one day and \# the next.}

	%eks is currently using 6 hard-lined characters #,$,@,\,",{ and (/ kinda) → change so that i remove $ and replace it with \ like latex?
	%xml is using 1 < (kinda)
	%latex is using 3 \,%,{
	
	\chapter{Background}
	
	My orginal purpose were to create a language which purpose is to be an easy to read markup language. 
	With languages such as XML its easy to read for the parser, but not always for the user. 
	Also there is some other flaws with XML such as the closing of a tag is unessesarly complicated which also takes plenty of space.
	Also XML may take some time to write in. 
	
	Well i have not only studied XML before going into writing a new markup-language.
	Pros and cons i can see in other languages is mentioned below.

	\section{XML}
	
	Pros:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item have multiline comments <!-- comment -->
		\item easy to understand, simple in design
	\end{itemize}
	
	Cons:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item too much text for describing a simple task.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{TeX}
	
	Pros:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item have single-line comments
		\item fairly easy to understand
		\item minimalistic for describing \emph{abc} instead of <emph>abc</emph>
	\end{itemize}
	
	Cons:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item little possibilities for nestling, reason behind begin\{\} and end\{\}
		\item no support for multiline comments
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Yaml}
	
	Pros:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Looks really nice
		\item fairly easy to understand
		\item minimalistic for describing emph:abc instead of <emph>abc</emph>
		\item nice with linkage
	\end{itemize}
	
	Cons:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item no multiline comments
		\item the intendation may create problems
		\item the datatype definitions in english may cause future problems
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{JSON}
	
	Pros:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item easy to understand
		\item fairly minimalistic for describing ''emph'':''abc'' instead of <emph>abc</emph>
	\end{itemize}
	
	Cons:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item no comments
		\item plenty of '':s
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Others}
	
	Other formats such as INI or similar is simple, but have little or bad support for nestling.
	
	\section{History}
	
	My absolute first version of EKS looked like this:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		&item1
		  !item_1_value_list_1
		    string1
		    string2
		    string3
		  !item_1_value_list_2
		    string1
		    string2
		    string3
		&item2
		  !item_2_value_list_1
		    string1
		    string2
		    string3
		  !item_2_value_list_2
		    string1
		    string2
		    string3
	\end{verbatim}
	
	When parsed it would become a list like this:\\
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		{
		  item1→{
		    item_1_value_list_1→{string1,string2,string3},
		    item_1_value_list_2→{string1,string2,string3}
		  },
		  item2→{
		    item_2_value_list_1→{string1,string2,string3},
		    item_2_value_list_2→{string1,string2,string3}
		  }
		}
	\end{verbatim}
	
	This design had some issues like that it unnecessary with the ! signs, and could be replaced by \&s. Therefor my next design looked like this:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		&item1
		  &&item_1_value_list_1
		    string1
		    string2
		    string3
		  &&item_1_value_list_2
		    string1
		    string2
		    string3
		&item2
		  &&item_2_value_list_1
		    string1
		    string2
		    string3
		  &&item_2_value_list_2
		    string1
		    string2
		    string3
	\end{verbatim}
	
	The result was the same. This was the first real version of this language which i liked, however i changed the \& sign, since i did not really think that it represented or symbolized an element which is the point of it to be.
	I also took some influences from the ''tex'' language, and implemented more features which i will explain in more detail below.
	
	\chapter{Goals}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Eks should not be bound to knowledge in the english language
		\item Eks should use symbols found on almost every thinkable keyboard layout (ASCII)
		\item Eks will focus on readability for humans rather than a \emph{type-really-fast} language
	\end{itemize}
	
	\chapter{The basics}
	
	\section{Simple example}
	
	When read, Eks will be divided like a vector or matrix. A \emph{buffer} or \emph{file} containing som understandable text will result in a vector like:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		hello world!
	\end{verbatim}
	
	This will result in a vector like:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
	toplevel→{hello world!}
	\end{verbatim}
	
	Eks will always have a toplevel aligned to it. The name of the topmost parent dont have to be named. It should just contain everything that can be seen from the \emph{input source}.
	
	You can then add a subelement like:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		hello world!
		
		#subelement{
		  this is some text for the subelement.
		}
	\end{verbatim}
	
	Which results into:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
	toplevel→{hello world!,subelement→{this is some text for the subelement.}}
	\end{verbatim}
	
	This is a simple way to know what's inside the element. \\
	You can also write as a list. one way is to do it like this:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		hello world!
		
		#list
		  first item
		  second item
	\end{verbatim}
	
	this results into:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
	toplevel→{
	  hello world!,
	  list→{first item,second item}
	}
	\end{verbatim}
	
	This is the preferable way if the user want to create a list of items.
	
	\section{Nestling of lists}
	
	As mentioned above the most favorable way of writing a list is by using \#s.
	Using this method allow you to write huge structures, like this:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		#list
		  ##1
		    ###a
		    ###b
		  ##2
		    ###a
		    ###b
	\end{verbatim}
	
	this results into:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
	toplevel→{
	  list→{1→{a,b},2→{a,b}}
	}
	\end{verbatim}
	
	However after a while it might be annoying to write \#s, so it might be an good idea to use \$ instead.
	\$ will be aligned at the current level and have the same meaning as \#.
	So the above example could have been written like this instead:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		#list
		  ##1
		    $a
		    $b
		  ##2
		    $a
		    $b
	\end{verbatim}
	
	\section{Variables}
	
	However it might be good to end lists, this is described below
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		hello world!
		
		#list
		  first item
		  second item
			
		what happens here?
		
	\end{verbatim}
	
	this results into:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
	{
	  hello world!,
	  list→{first item,second item,what happens here?}
	}
	\end{verbatim}
	
	To end the list, in case you want ''what happens here?'' in the root element, then just type:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		hello world!
		
		#list
		  first item
		  second item
		
		@!
		
		what happens here?
		oh changed line
		
	\end{verbatim}
	
	This will result into:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
	{
	  hello world!,list→{first item,second item},
	  what happens here?
	}
	\end{verbatim}
	
	Variables (@) can have different parameters, such are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{<} go down a level
		\item \emph{>} go up a level
		\item \emph{\# or \#\#\#...} decide the level for the parent
		\item \emph{!} go to the bottom level of a {} structure (root).
	\end{itemize}
	depending on where you are, you can insert variables accordingly. A variable may be written like this:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
	@variable
	\end{verbatim}
	
	but its also possible to assign the variable something:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
	@variable=123;
	\end{verbatim}
	
	and whatever you assign inside will be interpreted accordingly, you can even assign eks-content.
	
	\section{Nestling and huge lists}
	
	Then eks allows huge lists, like:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		hello world!
		
		#list
		  first item
		  second item
		  ##sublist
		    sublists first item
		    sublists second item
		  @<
		  
		  lists first item
		  
		//this will break the list so you go back to the root element
		@!
		
		/*
		  btw, eks support multi-line comments.
		*/
		what happens here?
		
	\end{verbatim}
	
	It results into:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
	{
	  hello world!,
	  list→{
	    first item,
	    second item,
	    sublist→{sublists first item,sublists second item},
	    lists first item
	  },
	  what happens here?
	}
	\end{verbatim}
	
	\chapter{Future proposals}
	
	Some of the ideas i have in mind atm is:
	
	\section{Space between objects}
		solve the issue with writing for example:
		\begin{verbatim}
		#something
		{
			hello $i{world}!
		}
		\end{verbatim}
		
		This would result into:
		
		\begin{verbatim}
		something→{hello,i→{world},!}
		\end{verbatim}
		
		Maybe it should be:
		
		\begin{verbatim}
		something→{"hello ",i→{world},!}
		\end{verbatim}
		
	\subsection{How it could be solved}
	
		For all newlines there will be ignores, however during one line it wont.
		
		So this would give the space
		
		\begin{verbatim}
		#something
		{
			hello $i{world}!
		}
		\end{verbatim}
		
		while this wont
		
		\begin{verbatim}
		#something
		{
			hello 
			$i{world}!
		}
		\end{verbatim}
	
	\section{Revamp the varibales into a new macro language}
	
	This idea is based so that the variables will be executed like macros, and that it will be linked to like a library, which in return will improve the speed. 
	Then it should be able to be executed like a macro language.
	The idea is like;
	
	Dollar sign ''@'' (maybe change the symbol? Other suggestions (\# (change in eks),\%,\&)) will work like the \# does like in the c preprocessor. 
	Then declared variables will be executed like functions (similar to C). However there is no predefined function from the start. Global variables should be called in other fashion.
	
	A theoretical example could look like this:
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		@include std.<filetype>
		
		//concatination, all types are strings (maybe char*-s) 
		@define func(a,b){int c=std_to_int(a)+std_to_int(b);return std_to_string(c)..b;}
		
		//returns the current line number
		@global(LINE_NUMBER)
		
		#hello
			func(43,65)
			
		//returns
		#hello
			10865
			
	\end{verbatim}
	
	\subsection{Advantages}
	
		There is no really good preprocessing language to use with this one. PHP is using XML syntax, also cannot call declared variables. M4 is just too complicated to use, like when doing turing based programming.
	
	\subsection{Problems}
	
		eks is working towards language neutrality. Languages like PHP,Javascript,VHDL etc pretty much require words for types such as INT,IF,ELSE etc. This macro language will walk into the same issue.
	
	\section{Nestle the dollarsigns}
	
	the \# can be nestled like this: \# then \#\# then \#\#\# etc.
	Why not do something similar for \$s
	Like the opposite, \$\$\$ (defines the highest level) then \$\$ then \$. 
	
	\section{The \\begin{something} problem}
	
		In latex you can do \\begin\{something\} and then \\end\{something\} This is good when encapsylating large amounts of data.
		The verbatim example is quite good. In verbatim it will first end when you really type \\end\{verbatim\} (noting else)
		This is also considered important in the xml language thats why they enforce the enclosure of each \<value\>:s
		
		This could be done in eks in multiple ways...
		
		\subsection{Using the variables}
		
		One way is @START_TEXT and @END_TEXT, however because of eks limits it would probably look more like this.
		
		\begin{verbatim}
		@''' \#misbehaving eks badly \$i \" \@! /** this wont be parsed in a wierd way and put into the large array */ @'''
		\end{verbatim}
		
		the amount of \' may indicate our seriousness. \@\'\'\'\'\'\' would mean plenty of seriousness
	
		\subsection{multiple curly brackets}
		
		The amount of curly brackets marks our seriousness, more than two means that it will be treaten like a string. More brackets means ofc more seriousness.
		
		Like:
		
		\begin{verbatim}
		#variable{{ \#misbehaving eks badly \$i \" \@! /** this wont be parsed in a wierd way and put into the large array */ }}
		\end{verbatim}
		
		The problem with this solution is that it wont be able to handle no-named vectors at the start of a vector.
		
		\subsection{Ending character}
		
		when \#value\# is started, then it has to end with \#/value\#.
		
		The example from above is used.	
		
		\begin{verbatim}
		#variable# \#misbehaving eks badly \$i \" \@! /** this wont be parsed in a wierd way and put into the large array */ #/variable#
		\end{verbatim}
		
		The problem here is that variables defined like this wont work:
		
		\begin{verbatim}
		#variable1#variable2#variable3
		\end{verbatim}
		
	\section{Other}
	
	\begin{verbatim}
		//Using code... maybe it should work similar to php...
		@%C%
		{
			int whatever=1+1;
		}
		
		//using functions would be nice
		func1(var1,var2)
		
		/*
		  i dunno how this should work... But it should be there
		*/
		
		//using functions
		@func(var1,var2)
		
		//declaring variables
		@var1=1234;
		
		/*
		  i dunno how this should work... But it should be there
		*/
		
		//including other files... i really dunno if it should look like this but its an idea.
		@>./filename.eks
		//or
		@>./filename.tex
		//or
		@>./filename.xml		
		
	\end{verbatim}
	
	Everything here is just ideas...
